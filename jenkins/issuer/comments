A python program reads the status of the playbook execution in /tmp/<YYYY-MM-DD-unique-run-id>/status file and creates a new comment at the issue github.com/openebs/e2e-results/issues/<unique-test-case-id>. The update structure would be something like:

Test run update from test.openebs.io
Test Plan id : YYYY-MM-DD-unique-run-id-AWS
Test case id : 1234
Ran for : 2 minutes
Status : Success
Logs : logs-e2e.openebs.io/<elastic link >
